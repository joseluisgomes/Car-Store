## Development of the project

The figure 1 shows the entity-relationship diagram of this project. From the analysis of this figure, We can conclude that this application relies on 4 entities: _Employee, User, Vehicle_ and _Authority_.

Through the above diagram, It is possible to map each entity into a _Java_ Class. The entity's attributes correspond to the state of the object. The figure 2 reflects the mentioned mapping.

<div align="center">

|   Entity   |       Class       |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|
|  Employee  |  `Employee.java`  |
|    User    |    `User.java`    |
|  Vehicle   |  `Vehicle.java`   |

</div>

Still inside the entity's discussion, some attributes need a special, an adequate treatment such as _Role, Fuel_ and _Motor_, which are attributes from _Employee_ and _Vehicle_ entities. Basically, the well suited solution is converting the mentioned attributes into _Java_ Enums.
<br />
The figure 3 demonstrates the connection between the cited entities and their attributes.

## The heartwood of the Website

As mentioned in the index, the web service/website performs different tasks according to the user's operations. The website is equipped with a login page, only available to the users registered on the database.
<br />
The figure 4 shows the website's login page.
